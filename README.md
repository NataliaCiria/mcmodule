# mcmodule
`mcmodule` provides a framework for building modular Monte Carlo risk analysis models. It extends the capabilities of `mc2d` to facilitate working with multiple risk pathways, variates and scenarios. The package includes tools for creating stochastic objects from data frames, visualising results, and performing uncertainty, sensitivity and convergence analysis.

```r
install.packages("mcmodule")
