Whereas the Poisson process assumes that the probability distribution of the number of events that occur in a specified interval depends only on the length of the interval, we also consider its generalization, the non homogeneous Poisson process, which allows this distribution to also depend on where the interval is situated on the real line.}

We propose a modular approach to the modelling and analysis of risk scenarios with dependencies. Our approach may be used to deduce the risk level of an overall system from previous risk analyses of its constituent systems. A custom made assumption-guarantee style is put forward as a means to describe risk scenarios with external dependencies. We also define a set of deduction rules facilitating various kinds of reasoning, including the analysis of mutual dependencies between risk scenarios expressed in the assumption-guarantee style.}
